# Usage
This project provides a [VS Code Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) configuration that launches the required dependencies. The base image is the [Nvidia PyTorch container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch?version=25.11-py3) `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.11-py3`, which includes GPU optimizations and support for the GB10 chip we used for this project.
